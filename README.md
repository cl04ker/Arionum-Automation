The following scripts have been written to automate your usage of the Arionum software on Ubuntu Linux.

I suggest that you clone this repository under a folder called "Arionum" in order to keep things tidy and organised. I keep mine at ```~/Crypto/Arionum/Arionum-Automation```

Clone this repository with ```git clone https://github.com/cl04ker/Arionum-Automation.git``` and then use one of the setup scripts depending on what you would like to achieve.

Please also don't forget to run ```git pull``` every so often to check for any updates I have made.
